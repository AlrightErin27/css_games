# CSS Gametime!!!

Let's learn CSS through games!!!

Play through each of these games. They will all give you feedback as you go. For each one:
  - Advance to the highest level you can
  - When you are finished, take a screen shot of your final level
  - Put that screenshot into this folder, `git add` & `git commit`. The screenshot is what you're turning in!
